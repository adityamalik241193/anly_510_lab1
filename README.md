# anly_510_lab1
This repository contains files regarding Lab 1 for the ANLY 560 course. The goal for Lab 1 for ANLY 560 course was to create an output table in mySQL which showed the following information for each film: "Film ID", "Film Name", "Film Category ID", and "Film Genre".

I've upoaded a .sql file which contains the code used for the lab, and a screenshot which details the output of the lab.
